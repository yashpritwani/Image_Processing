Image processing in Matlab using the pixel-matrix method

The program does the following work :-
1. It takes an input image and traces the major curves and highlight of the image using the pixel matrix method.
2. After that it shows the traced highlight points.
3. Next it takes any picture or even a video as input and tries to match the earlier highlighted curves or points with the present pixel data of picture/video.
4. After matching and processing , it shows the matched parts if the matched parts percentage is more than 70% it would show as person recognised.
5. The model for now has nearly 30 percent efficiency so it lots of improvements on which I am working upon to apply it as image recognition.
